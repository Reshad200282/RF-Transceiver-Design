## Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network or communication channel in a given amount of time.

- Typically measured in **bits per second (bps)**  
  - kbps (kilobits per second)  
  - Mbps (megabits per second)  
  - Gbps (gigabits per second)

### Example
- High bandwidth → faster data transfer (e.g., video streaming, file downloads)
- Low bandwidth → slower data transfer

### Analogy
Bandwidth is like the width of a road:
- Narrow road → fewer cars at a time (low bandwidth)
- Wide highway → many cars at once (high bandwidth)

Bandwidth basically means how much data can move from one place to another in a given amount of time.

Think of it like a road 🚗

A narrow road → only a few cars can pass at once → low bandwidth

A wide highway → lots of cars at the same time → high bandwidth

In tech terms

Bandwidth is usually:

Measured in bits per second (bps)

kbps = kilobits per second

Mbps = megabits per second

Gbps = gigabits per second

Used to describe internet connections, networks, or communication channels

Simple examples

Streaming video needs high bandwidth

Sending a text message needs very little bandwidth

Slow internet = low bandwidth (or too many users sharing it)

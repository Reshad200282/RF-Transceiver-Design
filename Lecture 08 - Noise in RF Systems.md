## **Noise is independent of frequency 

## Why Thermal noise is called white noise ?

1. What “white” means in noise

In signal processing, “white” comes from an analogy with white light.

White light = contains all colors (frequencies) equally

## White noise = contains all frequencies with equal power

## So if a noise has constant power spectral density (PSD) over frequency, we call it white.

2. Thermal noise property

For thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) noise, the power spectral density is:


## S_n(f) = kT

## Power Spectral Density of Thermal Noise in RF Systems
Thermal Noise (Johnson–Nyquist Noise)

Thermal noise is generated by the random thermal motion of charge carriers in any resistive element. It exists in all RF systems and sets a fundamental noise floor that cannot be eliminated.

Thermal noise is:

White (flat PSD over frequency)

Gaussian

Present whenever temperature $T > 0 \ \text{K}$

Noise Power Spectral Density

The power spectral density (PSD) of thermal noise is given by:

## 𝑆_𝑛(f)=kT [W/Hz]
​

This means:

It does NOT depend on frequency $f$

Power per Hz is flat across the frequency axis

# Noise Sources, Noise Temperature, and Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)

This slide explains **noise sources**, **noise temperature**, and **Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)**, which are fundamental concepts in RF and microwave measurements.


##  ENR(excess noise ratio)  How much hotter the noise source is than room temperature
---

## 1. Noise Through an Amplifier

### Input Noise

- $N_0$ : Thermal noise power from a matched source  
  (usually **50 Ω at room temperature**)

Thermal noise power is given by:

$$
N_0 = k T B
$$

where:
- $k$ = Boltzmann’s constant  
- $T$ = absolute temperature (≈ 290 K at room temperature)  
- $B$ = bandwidth (Hz)

---

### Amplifier

- Gain = $G$
- Assumed **linear** and **impedance matched**

---

### Output Noise

After amplification, the output noise power becomes:

$$
P_o = G k T B
$$

This shows that thermal noise at the input is simply multiplied by the amplifier gain.

---

### Equivalent Noise Temperature

The equivalent noise temperature is defined as:

$$
T_e = \frac{N_0}{G k B}
$$

**Interpretation:**
- $T_e$ represents the input temperature that would generate the observed noise power
- It allows noise to be expressed in **temperature units** instead of watts
- Very useful for characterizing noisy RF devices

---

## 2. Active Noise Source

An **active noise source** is a calibrated device designed to intentionally generate noise.

### Examples
- Noise diodes  
- Vacuum tubes  
- Solid-state noise sources  

### Why They Are Useful
- Produce **known and repeatable noise levels**
- Essential for measuring **noise figure** and **receiver sensitivity**
- Allow accurate system testing using controlled noise input

---

## 3. Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)

### Definition (Power Form)

The **Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)** is defined as:

$$
\text{ENR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}
\left(
\frac{N_g - N_0}{N_0}
\right)
$$

where:
- $N_g$ = noise power when the noise generator is **ON**
- $N_0$ = thermal noise power of a 50 Ω resistor at room temperature

ENR measures how much **additional noise** the source produces beyond thermal noise.

---

### Temperature Form (Important)

ENR can also be expressed using noise temperature:

$$
\text{ENR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}
\left(
\frac{T_g - T_0}{T_0}
\right)
$$

where:
- $T_g$ = equivalent noise temperature of the noise generator
- $T_0$ = room temperature (≈ 290 K)

**Key Insight:**
- ENR is fundamentally a **temperature ratio**
- A high ENR corresponds to a very high equivalent noise temperature

---

## 4. Definitions (Bottom Notes)

- $N_g$ : Noise power from the **noise generator**
- $N_0$ : Noise power from a **50 Ω termination at room temperature**

These represent the two reference noise states used in practical **ON/OFF noise measurements**.

---

## Big Picture Intuition

- Thermal noise originates from temperature: $kTB$
- Amplifiers increase noise power by their gain
- Noise sources behave like extremely “hot” resistors
- ENR indicates how much hotter the noise source is compared to room temperature
- These concepts are essential for **noise figure measurement** and **receiver performance evaluation**

# Noise Figure (NF) — Detailed Explanation

This section explains **Noise Figure** step-by-step, with physical intuition and full mathematical derivation, as used in RF and microwave system design.

---

## 1. Physical Meaning of Noise Figure

Noise Figure quantifies how much **extra noise** a system adds compared to an ideal, noiseless system.

- Signal **must** be amplified  
- Noise **should not** be amplified or added (but it always is)  
- NF measures this unavoidable degradation  

If:

- $\text{SNR}_{\text{in}} = \text{SNR}_{\text{out}}$ → ideal system  
- $\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} < \text{SNR}_{\text{in}}$ → real system  

---

## 2. Formal Definition

Noise **factor** is defined as:

$$
F = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{in}}}{\text{SNR}_{\text{out}}}
$$

Since all real systems add noise:

$$
F \ge 1
$$

Noise **figure** (in decibels):

$$
\text{NF} = 10 \log_{10}(F)
$$

---

## 3. Input Noise Power (Thermal Noise)

At the input, noise is dominated by thermal noise:

$$
N_i = k T_0 B
$$

where:
- $k$ = Boltzmann constant  
- $T_0 = 290 \ \text{K}$ (standard reference temperature)  
- $B$ = system bandwidth  

---

## 4. Signal and Noise Flow Through a System

Assume a system with power gain $G$.

### Signal

$$
S_o = G S_i
$$

### Noise

Output noise has **two components**:

1. Amplified input noise:
   $$
   G N_i
   $$

2. Noise added by the system:
   $$
   N_{\text{added}}
   $$

Total output noise:

$$
N_o = G N_i + N_{\text{added}}
$$

---

## 5. SNR Degradation Derivation

### Input SNR

$$
\text{SNR}_{\text{in}} = \frac{S_i}{N_i}
$$

### Output SNR

$$
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} =
\frac{G S_i}{G N_i + N_{\text{added}}}
$$

Substitute into the noise factor definition:

$$
F =
\frac{S_i / N_i}
{G S_i / (G N_i + N_{\text{added}})}
$$

Cancel $S_i$:

$$
F = \frac{G N_i + N_{\text{added}}}{G N_i}
$$

$$
F = 1 + \frac{N_{\text{added}}}{G N_i}
$$

---

## 6. Equivalent Noise Temperature

The system’s added noise is modeled as thermal noise from an **equivalent noise temperature** $T_e$:

$$
N_{\text{added}} = k T_e B
$$

Amplified input noise:

$$
G N_i = G k T_0 B
$$

Substitute into the noise factor expression:

$$
F =
\frac{k (T_0 + T_e) B}
{k T_0 B}
$$

Final result:

$$
F = 1 + \frac{T_e}{T_0}
$$

---

## 7. Interpretation of Equivalent Noise Temperature

- $T_e$ is **not** a physical temperature  
- It represents how noisy the system behaves  
- Lower $T_e$ ⇒ lower NF ⇒ better receiver  

Examples:

- Ideal system: $T_e = 0 \Rightarrow F = 1$  
- Practical LNA: $T_e \approx 50$–$150 \ \text{K}$  

---

## 8. Noise Figure in dB (Practical Form)

$$
\text{NF (dB)} =
10 \log_{10}
\left(
1 + \frac{T_e}{T_0}
\right)
$$

At $T_0 = 290 \ \text{K}$:

- $F = 2$ → NF = 3 dB  
- $F = 4$ → NF = 6 dB  

---

## 9. Why Noise Figure Is Always ≥ 1

- Resistors generate thermal noise  
- Active devices generate shot and flicker noise  
- Matching networks introduce loss  
- Loss **before** gain is especially harmful  

Therefore:

> **The first RF stage dominates the overall system noise figure**

---

## 10. Practical RF Design Insight

- Low-Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) must have **very low NF**
- High gain **after** the LNA is acceptable
- Passive loss before the LNA severely degrades NF

This directly leads to the **Friis Noise Formula** for cascaded stages.

---

## 11. Key Results Summary

- $F = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{in}}}{\text{SNR}_{\text{out}}}$
- $F = 1 + \frac{T_e}{T_0}$
- $\text{NF} = 10 \log_{10}(F)$
- Lower NF ⇒ better receiver sensitivity
- First stage NF is critical

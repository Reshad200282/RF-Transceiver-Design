## Active Noise Source

An **active noise source** is a device or circuit that **intentionally generates electrical noise** using **active components** and an **external power supply**.

---

## Key Idea

```
Active device + DC power → controlled noise
```

---

## How It Works

* Uses active components such as:

  * Transistors
  * Reverse-biased noise - diodes
* Requires an external DC supply
* Generated noise is amplified to a usable level

---

## Types of Noise Generated

* Thermal noise
* Shot noise
* Avalanche noise

---

## Why Active Noise Source Is Used

* Noise figure measurement
* RF receiver testing
* System calibration
* Wideband noise generation

---

## Examples

* Avalanche noise diode
* Transistor-based noise generator

---

## Active vs Passive Noise Source

**Active Noise Source**

* Requires power
* Noise level is controllable
* High output noise

**Passive Noise Source**

* No external power
* Fixed noise level
* Low output noise

---

## One-Line Exam Answer

```
An active noise source is a powered circuit that intentionally generates noise using active devices.
```

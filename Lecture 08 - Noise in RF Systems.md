## **Noise is independent of frequency 

## Why Thermal noise is called white noise ?

1. What “white” means in noise

In signal processing, “white” comes from an analogy with white light.

White light = contains all colors (frequencies) equally

## White noise = contains all frequencies with equal power

## So if a noise has constant power spectral density (PSD) over frequency, we call it white.

2. Thermal noise property

For thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) noise, the power spectral density is:


## S_n(f) = kT

## Power Spectral Density of Thermal Noise in RF Systems
Thermal Noise (Johnson–Nyquist Noise)

Thermal noise is generated by the random thermal motion of charge carriers in any resistive element. It exists in all RF systems and sets a fundamental noise floor that cannot be eliminated.

Thermal noise is:

White (flat PSD over frequency)

Gaussian

Present whenever temperature $T > 0 \ \text{K}$

Noise Power Spectral Density

The power spectral density (PSD) of thermal noise is given by:

## 𝑆_𝑛(f)=kT [W/Hz]
​

This means:

It does NOT depend on frequency $f$

Power per Hz is flat across the frequency axis

## Active Noise Source

An **active noise source** is a device or circuit that **intentionally generates electrical noise** using **active components** and an **external power supply**.

---

## Key Idea

```
Active device + DC power → controlled noise
```

---

## How It Works

* Uses active components such as:

  * Transistors
  * Reverse-biased noise - diodes
* Requires an external DC supply
* Generated noise is amplified to a usable level

---

## Types of Noise Generated

* Thermal noise
* Shot noise
* Avalanche noise

---

## Why Active Noise Source Is Used

* Noise figure measurement
* RF receiver testing
* System calibration
* Wideband noise generation

---

## Examples

* Avalanche noise diode
* Transistor-based noise generator

---

## Active vs Passive Noise Source

**Active Noise Source**

* Requires power
* Noise level is controllable
* High output noise

**Passive Noise Source**

* No external power
* Fixed noise level
* Low output noise

---

## One-Line Exam Answer

```
An active noise source is a powered circuit that intentionally generates noise using active devices.

# Noise Sources, Noise Temperature, and Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)

This slide explains **noise sources**, **noise temperature**, and **Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)**, which are fundamental concepts in RF and microwave measurements.

---

## 1. Noise Through an Amplifier

### Input Noise

- $N_0$ : Thermal noise power from a matched source  
  (usually **50 Ω at room temperature**)

Thermal noise power is given by:

$$
N_0 = k T B
$$

where:
- $k$ = Boltzmann’s constant  
- $T$ = absolute temperature (≈ 290 K at room temperature)  
- $B$ = bandwidth (Hz)

---

### Amplifier

- Gain = $G$
- Assumed **linear** and **impedance matched**

---

### Output Noise

After amplification, the output noise power becomes:

$$
P_o = G k T B
$$

This shows that thermal noise at the input is simply multiplied by the amplifier gain.

---

### Equivalent Noise Temperature

The equivalent noise temperature is defined as:

$$
T_e = \frac{N_0}{G k B}
$$

**Interpretation:**
- $T_e$ represents the input temperature that would generate the observed noise power
- It allows noise to be expressed in **temperature units** instead of watts
- Very useful for characterizing noisy RF devices

---

## 2. Active Noise Source

An **active noise source** is a calibrated device designed to intentionally generate noise.

### Examples
- Noise diodes  
- Vacuum tubes  
- Solid-state noise sources  

### Why They Are Useful
- Produce **known and repeatable noise levels**
- Essential for measuring **noise figure** and **receiver sensitivity**
- Allow accurate system testing using controlled noise input

---

## 3. Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)

### Definition (Power Form)

The **Excess Noise Ratio (ENR)** is defined as:

$$
\text{ENR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}
\left(
\frac{N_g - N_0}{N_0}
\right)
$$

where:
- $N_g$ = noise power when the noise generator is **ON**
- $N_0$ = thermal noise power of a 50 Ω resistor at room temperature

ENR measures how much **additional noise** the source produces beyond thermal noise.

---

### Temperature Form (Important)

ENR can also be expressed using noise temperature:

$$
\text{ENR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}
\left(
\frac{T_g - T_0}{T_0}
\right)
$$

where:
- $T_g$ = equivalent noise temperature of the noise generator
- $T_0$ = room temperature (≈ 290 K)

**Key Insight:**
- ENR is fundamentally a **temperature ratio**
- A high ENR corresponds to a very high equivalent noise temperature

---

## 4. Definitions (Bottom Notes)

- $N_g$ : Noise power from the **noise generator**
- $N_0$ : Noise power from a **50 Ω termination at room temperature**

These represent the two reference noise states used in practical **ON/OFF noise measurements**.

---

## Big Picture Intuition

- Thermal noise originates from temperature: $kTB$
- Amplifiers increase noise power by their gain
- Noise sources behave like extremely “hot” resistors
- ENR indicates how much hotter the noise source is compared to room temperature
- These concepts are essential for **noise figure measurement** and **receiver performance evaluation**

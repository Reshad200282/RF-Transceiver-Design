Active Noise Source

An active noise source is a circuit or device that intentionally generates noise using active components and an external power supply.

Key Idea
Active device + biasing → controlled noise generation

How It Works

Uses active devices such as:

Transistors

Diodes (reverse-biased)

Requires external DC power

Noise is generated and amplified to a usable level

Types of Noise Generated

Thermal noise

Shot noise

Avalanche noise

Why Active Noise Sources Are Used

Active noise sources are used to:

Test RF receivers

Measure noise figure

Calibrate RF systems

Generate wideband noise

Common Example

Noise diode (avalanche diode)

Transistor-based noise generator

Active vs Passive Noise Source
Feature	Active Noise Source	Passive Noise Source
External power	Required	Not required
Noise control	Adjustable	Fixed
Output level	High	Low
Applications	Testing, calibration	Natural noise modeling
One-Line Exam Answer
An active noise source is a powered circuit that intentionally generates noise using active devices.

## **Noise is independent of frequency 

## Why Thermal noise is called white noise ?

1. What “white” means in noise

In signal processing, “white” comes from an analogy with white light.

White light = contains all colors (frequencies) equally

White noise = contains all frequencies with equal power

So if a noise has constant power spectral density (PSD) over frequency, we call it white.

2. Thermal noise property

For thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) noise, the power spectral density is:


 S_n(f) = kT

Power Spectral Density of Thermal Noise in RF Systems
Thermal Noise (Johnson–Nyquist Noise)

Thermal noise is generated by the random thermal motion of charge carriers in any resistive element. It exists in all RF systems and sets a fundamental noise floor that cannot be eliminated.

Thermal noise is:

White (flat PSD over frequency)

Gaussian

Present whenever temperature $T > 0 \ \text{K}$

Noise Power Spectral Density

The power spectral density (PSD) of thermal noise is given by:

𝑆_𝑛(f)=kT [W/Hz]
​

This means:

It does NOT depend on frequency $f$

Power per Hz is flat across the frequency axis

## Active Noise Source

An **active noise source** is a device or circuit that **intentionally generates electrical noise** using **active components** and an **external power supply**.

---

## Key Idea

```
Active device + DC power → controlled noise
```

---

## How It Works

* Uses active components such as:

  * Transistors
  * Reverse-biased noise - diodes
* Requires an external DC supply
* Generated noise is amplified to a usable level

---

## Types of Noise Generated

* Thermal noise
* Shot noise
* Avalanche noise

---

## Why Active Noise Source Is Used

* Noise figure measurement
* RF receiver testing
* System calibration
* Wideband noise generation

---

## Examples

* Avalanche noise diode
* Transistor-based noise generator

---

## Active vs Passive Noise Source

**Active Noise Source**

* Requires power
* Noise level is controllable
* High output noise

**Passive Noise Source**

* No external power
* Fixed noise level
* Low output noise

---

## One-Line Exam Answer

```
An active noise source is a powered circuit that intentionally generates noise using active devices.
